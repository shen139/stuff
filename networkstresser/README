(n)FAQ:

What do I do after decompresseing the archive in a directory?
> You must compile the sources with: "gcc stresser-[VERSION].c -o stresser"
  Now you can execute "stresser" 
  (from version 0.5 and later stresser uses the threads and so remember to add at the 
   command line of gcc: "-lpthread")

It says me that I must be root! Why?
> this program uses the raw sockets and so only root can execute it

What is this for?
> It's for subjecting to stress a network or a part of it while it recives a lot of packets

At what does it serve to me?
> a possible use of the stresser is to test if your network(or your PC) can carry a
  flood attack

Is it legal?
> Yes! If the attack is finalized to test your network and does not involve other nodes
  outside your network or if the administrators of the networks involved or who for them
  agree! it's fully legal

Can my network be damaged after an attack?
> No! You risk only to lose datas in unsaved files in the case the system crashes

What kind of packets can I send? with stresser?
> Tcp packets(with syn flag setted up), udp, icmp(ping) and igmp
