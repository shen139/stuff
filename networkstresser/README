(n)FAQ:

What do I do after decompressing the archive in a directory?
> You must compile the sources with: "gcc stresser-[VERSION].c -o stresser -lpthread"

It says me that I must be root! Why?
> this program uses the raw sockets and so only root can execute it

What is this for?
> It's for subjecting to stress a network or a part of it while it recives a lot of packets

At what does it serve to me?
> a possible use of the stresser is to test if your network(or your PC) can carry a
  flood attack

Is it legal?
> Yes! If the attack is finalized to test your network and does not involve other nodes
  outside your network or if the administrators of the networks involved or who for them
  agree! it's fully legal

Can my network be damaged after an attack?
> No! You risk only to lose datas in unsaved files in the case the system crashes

What kind of packets can I send with stresser?
> Tcp packets(with SYN and/or RST flags setted up), udp, icmp(ping) and igmp

Real Time mode and Fast mode?!? What are them?
> executing stresser in Real Time mode the scheduler assign to the process the 100% of the cpu clocks
  stopping all others program in execution and making stresser more performant
  Fast mode instead optimize the ridondant operation of the program by creating a packet of the selected
  protocol and sending it again and again without consider if there are others IP in list
  and without create random IP at exclusion of the first that than will be always the same


Examples:

./stresser -i 123.321.132.213,mysite.orx:www.hello.ciz -t 11.22.33.44,12.23.34.45:xxx.cot 21,22,80 -s 30
./stresser -r -t RANDOM,66.66.66.66:32.23.33.22 139 -s 45
./stresser -f -u 83.34.58.124:74.233.65.32 139 -T 56.34.87.45:98.34.45.56 1234:8080 123456

*   In Real Time mode (-r) all the cpu clocks are assigned to the process making impossible
    other operations (unrecommended the use under X)

**  RANDOM generates a random IP number at each iteration

*** In Fast Mode (-f) is created one packet in memory and only that is sent out so if you also put
    more than one IP the sent packet will use the first ip addresses
